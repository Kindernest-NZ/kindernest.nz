# Kindernest - German Playgroup Wellington

## Description

This playgroup is for Pre-school children. The group aims to promote German culture and language so all participants are asked to speak German during the group session to allow the children to have a regular exposure to the German language (even if the children choose not to respond in German). Also holds an annual German fair.

The playgroup is a parent co-operative, participants are expected to contribute to the running of the session including: setting up, supervise / run structured activities for the children (younger 0-2 years, older 2-5 years) as well as cleaning up.

## Eligibility

Children up to 5 years of age with German heritage (e.g. one or both parents are German) or with other German background.
